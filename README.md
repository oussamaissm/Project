Last year, I faced the challenge of preparing for an exam that covered a broad spectrum of subjects, including math, physics, and chemistry. With around 30 courses in mathematics, at least 10 in physics, and approximately 9 in chemistry, it became imperative to devise an efficient study strategy. The exam, however, doesn't exceed 5 topics.
Sp I developed a program that randomly selects topics from the extensive course list also I utilized the resources available on 'doc-solus.fr' to find exams that specifically included the selected topics.

---> Feel free to modify the program to accommodate additional topics.


---> You can adjust the variables based on your specific needs.


---> And if the exam is approaching soon, well, you know what to do!
