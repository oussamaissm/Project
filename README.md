Last year, I encountered the challenge of preparing for an exam that encompassed a wide array of subjects, spanning math, physics, and chemistry. With approximately 30 mathematics courses, at least 10 in physics, and around 9 in chemistry, it became essential to formulate an effective study strategy. The exam, however, focused on no more than 5 topics.

To address this, I developed a program that randomly selects topics from the extensive course list. I also utilized the resources available on 'doc-solus.fr' to find exams specifically covering the selected topics.

---> Employ sql_.py to create database(if not created), tables(topics) and columns representing the courses, with values indicating how many times they were generated.


---> Employ genearte.py to generate topics.


---> Feel free to modify the program to accommodate additional topics.


---> You can adjust the variables based on your specific needs.


---> And if the exam is approaching soon, well, you know what to do!
